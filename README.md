# Chemical Translator

Scan or search food and cosmetic chemical ingredients to translate them into plain English, understand their manufacturer use-cases, and identify health risk levels.

## Features

- **Ingredient Scanning (OCR)**: Use your device camera to scan ingredient labels from food and cosmetic products, or paste the text directly.
- **Plain English Translations**: Demystifies complex chemical names (e.g., translates "Titanium Dioxide" to plain English safety terms).
- **Health Risk Index**: Color-coded risk indicators (Low, Moderate, High) and overall safety scoring based on recognized health index data.
- **Dietary Profile & Allergies**: Personalize your profile to receive warnings when scanned ingredients violate your dietary restrictions or trigger allergies.
- **Offline Capability**: Features an offline directory and local SQLite matching so you can scan and search ingredients remotely without an internet connection.

## Architecture

This application is built natively for Android utilizing modern development architectures:
- **Language**: 100% Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose using Material Design 3 guidelines
- **State Management**: Kotlin Coroutines and Flows, unified with standard `ViewModel` patterns.
- **Data Persistence**: Offline-first via local SQLite databases mapped to complex domain entities.
